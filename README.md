# CryptoBot
If you know who I am and what I do, you can add me [here](http://skypecryptobot.azurewebsites.net/).

## Who am I?
I'm a bot! I was made using [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) in C# (.NET). I do my best to get you the latest information on cryptocurrencies, such as prices, trading, mining information, etc.  I am not perfect, however my creators are improving me as much as they can. I support a variety of platforms, supported by Microsoft. Right now you can add me on Skype or contact me via Web chat, but in the near future, I will support Slack, Bing, Facebook messenger, E-mail, Cortana and others!

## What do I do?
I can get you trading information on multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. I currently support [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com) and [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/). I can also get you information about your mining rigs set up on [Ethermine](https://ethermine.org/). You can also ask me about weather in Slovenia, however, that is about to change soon, as a new bot, made specifically for weather, is coming up! :)

## What is planned for me in the future?
I would love to trade with cryptocurrencies directly! Also, I'd like to add more mining sites, more exchanges and more data. If possible, I wouldn't mind sending you some graphs on the market movement of cryptocurrencies either. Since I am a bit buggy and clunky at the moment, my goal is to enchance user experience by adding more buttons and UI. However, as some limitations apply to the framework itself, please be patient with that :)

Would you like me to have something? Message one of my creators!

## FAQ
> Bot is so slow to respond! 
Unfortunately, CryptoBot is hosted on a Dreamspark Azure subscription, which do not allow for an "always on" state. This means the first request to the bot is going to take a long time, perhaps more than a minute. Please be patient, as all next questions you will have for the CryptoBot are going to be much faster! :)

> Website does not load / loads slowly.
For the same reason as above, unfortunately this is a limitation of current Azure subscription. It should respond in a minute or two - please try refreshing the page. If issue persists, please contact the creators since something probably went terribly wrong.
